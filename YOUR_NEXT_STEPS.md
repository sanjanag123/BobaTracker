# Perfect! You're in the Right Place! ✅

Great job! Your terminal shows `BobaTracker %` which means you're in the correct folder.

## Now Run These Commands (One at a Time)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Type this and press Enter:

```bash
npm install
```

**What will happen:**
- You'll see lots of text scrolling (that's normal!)
- It's downloading all the packages your app needs
- This takes 1-3 minutes
- Wait until you see `BobaTracker %` again (means it's done)

### Step 2: Start Your App

After `npm install` finishes, type this and press Enter:

```bash
npm run dev
```

**What will happen:**
- Your app will start compiling
- You'll see messages like "compiling..." 
- Eventually you'll see: `Ready on http://localhost:3000`
- **Keep this terminal window open** - your app is running!

### Step 3: Open in Browser

1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc.)
2. Go to: **http://localhost:3000**
3. You should see your Boba Tracker app! 🎉

## What You Should See

Your terminal should look like this:

```
BobaTracker % npm install
[downloads packages...]
added 1000+ packages

BobaTracker % npm run dev
✓ Ready in 2.3s
○ Local: http://localhost:3000
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser!

## Troubleshooting

### If `npm install` gives an error:
- Make sure you have Node.js installed: type `node --version`
- If not, install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)

### If the browser shows "This site can't be reached":
- Make sure `npm run dev` is still running in the terminal
- Make sure you're going to `http://localhost:3000` (not https://)

### To stop the server:
- In the terminal, press `Ctrl + C`

**You're ready! Just type `npm install` and press Enter!** 🚀
